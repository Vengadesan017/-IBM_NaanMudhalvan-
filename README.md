# Project Steps

Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking

Problem Definition: The project involves creating a chatbot using IBM Cloud Watson Assistant. The goal is to develop a virtual guide that assists users on messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and Slack. The chatbot should provide helpful information, answer frequently asked questions (FAQs), and offer a friendly conversational experience. The project includes designing the chatbot's persona, configuring responses, integrating with messaging platforms, and ensuring a seamless user experience.

Design Thinking:

Persona Design: Define the chatbot's persona, including its name, tone, and style of communication.
User Scenarios: Identify common user scenarios and FAQs that the chatbot should be able to address.
Conversation Flow: Design the conversation flow, outlining how the chatbot responds to user queries and prompts.
Response Configuration: Configure the chatbot's responses using Watson Assistant's intents, entities, and dialog nodes
Platform Integration: Integrate the chatbot with popular messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and Slack.
User Experience: Ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience, with clear prompts and informative responses.
Phase 2: Innovation

Consider implementing advanced features such as natural language understanding (NLU) for more accurate user intent recognition.

Phase 3: Development Part 1

Start building the chatbot using IBM Cloud Watson Assistant.

Phase 4: Development Part 2

Continue building the chatbot by integrating it with messaging platforms and refining the responses.

Phase 5: Project Documentation & Submission

Document the chatbot deployment project and prepare it for submission.


# Deploying the Chatbot on Facebook Messenger:

1. **Create a Facebook App:**
   - Go to the Facebook Developers Portal (https://developers.facebook.com/).
   - Create a new Facebook App or use an existing one.

2. **Set Up a Facebook Page:**
   - Create a Facebook Page for your business or organization if you don't already have one.

3. **Configure Webhooks:**
   - In your Facebook App settings, configure Webhooks to subscribe to specific events, including messages, postbacks, etc.
   - Provide a public URL (e.g., a server or cloud service) where your chatbot will be hosted as the callback URL. This URL should handle incoming messages from Facebook.

4. **Integrate with Watson Assistant:**
   - In your code or server hosted at the callback URL, handle incoming messages from Facebook Messenger using the Facebook Graph API.
   - Use the IBM Watson Assistant Python SDK or another relevant tool to send and receive messages with Watson Assistant.

5. **Verify the Webhook:**
   - Facebook requires webhook verification. Your server should respond to the verification request with the correct data to confirm the integration.

6. **Subscribe to the Page:**
   - Subscribe your Facebook App to your Facebook Page so it can receive messages and events.

7. **Test the Chatbot:**
   - Test your chatbot on Facebook Messenger by sending messages to your Facebook Page. Ensure it responds accurately to user queries.

**Deploying the Chatbot on Slack:**

1. **Create a Slack App:**
   - Go to the Slack API Developer Portal (https://api.slack.com/apps).
   - Create a new Slack App or use an existing one.

2. **Configure Event Subscriptions:**
   - Enable Event Subscriptions for your Slack App and subscribe to specific events, such as message events.
   - Provide a public URL (e.g., a server or cloud service) where your chatbot will be hosted to receive incoming messages from Slack.

3. **Interact with Slack API:**
   - In your code or server hosted at the callback URL, handle incoming messages from Slack and use the IBM Watson Assistant Python SDK or a relevant tool to send and receive messages with Watson Assistant.

4. **Subscribe to Bot Events:**
   - In your Slack App settings, subscribe to events related to the chatbot's activities.

5. **Install the App:**
   - Install your Slack App to your Slack workspace, allowing it to interact with users.

6. **Test the Chatbot:**
   - Test your chatbot in your Slack workspace by sending messages. Ensure that it responds accurately to user queries.

**Security Considerations:**
- Ensure that you securely manage API keys and access credentials when integrating with external platforms.
- Follow best practices for securing your callback URL and protecting user data.

Please note that these are general steps, and each platform may have specific requirements and configurations. Make sure to refer to the official documentation for Facebook Messenger and Slack for detailed integration instructions.
